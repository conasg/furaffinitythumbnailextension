# FurAffinity Thumbnail Extension

This repository is a hastily put together Google Chrome extension that replaces thumbnails with the full size original images across the FurAffinity website. This allows the website to be zoomed in, or for images to be saved easily.

Because this extension inadvertently loads each image in its own request, it can cause a minor slowdown. Images are also loaded gradually, meaning that images at the top of the page will 'jump' to the high quality version before lower images.
